# Laporan PTT Template
Adapted from docx version

This template is made for anyone who normally uses or just wants to try using LaTeX to write a report.

There are two important files that you can modify, namely cover.tex and content.tex. 

## cover.tex
As its name says, is used as the cover, you can modify the content by changing it to the corresponding title, identity, and labs. 

## content.tex
This file contains the main contents such as Abstrak, Pendahuluan, Dasar Teori, etc. 

## Note
You are allowed to change the format, but DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!

## Compiling
First, you need to install LaTeX distribution on your own machine. For Windows users, you can install MiKTeX or proTeXt. For Mac OS users, you can install MacTeX.

If LaTeX has been installed on your machine, you can simply open the terminal in "ptt" directory and type 

```
make all
```

The output pdf file will be `main.pdf`
